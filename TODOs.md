##TO DOS
- Add credit for Pexels API
  Whenever you are doing an API request make sure to show a prominent link to Pexels. 
  You can use a text link (e.g. "Photos provided by Pexels") or a link with our logo.
  Always credit our photographers when possible 
  (e.g. "Photo by John Doe on Pexels" with a link to the photo page on Pexels). 


##BUGS
- What happens when the word introduced is wrong?


##EXTRAS
- As a USER I want to choose which language I'm using


##DONE
- searched word (title) needs to be capitalised
- Added synonyms to the diferent definitions
- loop so we can have several phonetics if there's several
